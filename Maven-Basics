Maven is a build tool and project management tool.
By using Maven we can create the folder structures and executable file (i.e., .war file).
We can deploy these .war files into multiple environments like Dev, QA and UAT.
To do this, we need to launch a server in Google cloud platform.
Maven is used for building and deploying applications.
For this, Maven requries Java, Git and JDK.
There are three types of repositories in Maven. 
They are: 1. Central repository.
          2. Local repository and
          3. Remote repository.
Whenever created a project in Maven, creates a .m2 folder automatically and stores all the dependencies. 
The .m2 folder is present in local repository.
Maven lifecycle stages:1. clean.
